# HTML-CSS-JS
Playground for web developing/testing 
Working on a website from scratch about the underground car culture, what it is, why people join and what keeps them coming back for more.
Looking to add a menu on the top for the Home, Blog, Contact and Shop options
Planning to make the navigation menu interactive using either CSS/JS or a combination of both, 
maybe with an eventListener for clicks. Will test a few ways and see how the final project turns out.
